Why do 90% of DeFi trading bots fail? 📉
They rely on static strategies in a non-stationary market.
When the "weather" changes, they freeze—or get liquidated.
Enter @cortexagent: The first Multi-Agent System using Markov Regime Switching on Solana. 🧵👇

2/8
🧠 The Problem: Regime Heterogeneity.
Markets aren't flat. They cycle through 5 states:
1️⃣ Accumulation (Chop)
2️⃣ Markup (Bull)
3️⃣ Distribution (Top)
4️⃣ Markdown (Bear)
5️⃣ Crisis (Crash)
A strategy that wins in (2) gets slaughtered in (5).

3/8
🤖 The Squad (Multi-Agent Architecture).
Cortex isn't one bot. It's a swarm of specialized agents:
• Momentum Agents (for Bull runs)
• Mean-Reversion Agents (for Chop)
• Arbitrage Agents (Always watching)
They don't fight; they cooperate based on the current regime.

4/8
🔮 The Brain: Markov Regime Switching (MRS).
Most bots use thresholds ("If RSI > 70, Sell"). That lags.
Cortex uses MRS to calculate the *probability* of a regime change in real-time.
It fuses on-chain data (liquidity depth, funding rates) to predict shifts *before* they kill PnL.

5/8
⚡ Cortex vs. The Rest.
@JupiterExchange is the king of agg. @DriftProtocol has great vaults.
But most vaults are "Static" (e.g., Delta Neutral stays DN forever).
Cortex is "Dynamic".
• Market crashing? ➡️ Switch to Crisis Mode (Preserve Capital).
• Market pumping? ➡️ Switch to Momentum Mode.

6/8
📉 Scenario: The Flash Crash.
A standard "Buy the Dip" bot keeps buying as SOL drops 20%. Rekt.
Cortex's MRS detects "Crisis Regime" via spiking volatility.
It shuts down long agents, activates hedging, and waits for "Accumulation" signals.

7/8
🏗️ Built on Solana.
Why? Speed is survival.
To rebalance a multi-agent system block-by-block, you need 400ms finality.
Cortex fuses off-chain computation with on-chain execution to minimize model risk.

8/8
🚀 The Future is Autonomous.
We are moving from "Automated" (Rule-based) to "Autonomous" (Goal-based).
Cortex is the next evolution of DeFi infrastructure: Systems that learn, adapt, and survive.
